# Space shooter :


## starting plan :
Space shooter will be a more electorate version of the previous dodger typy game.
With the enemy targets coming from above and going down. Additionally, the player will be able to shoot at the ship
to score. The rectangles will be replaced with drawing in this version.

## Issues faced :

1. Getting a bullet to collide with enemy ship.

### Future Plans :

1. Add levels
2. At this point, it would take little effort to alter this in to a space invader type game. So this is a possible
   continuation of this project.
3. Add a fancier background.
